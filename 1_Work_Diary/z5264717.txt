Week 1.
Formed Group. Joined both the Jira & Github Accounts. Introduced myself and got to know others in the group.
Talked about plans for next week, such as figuring at three features that will help improve the website.

Week 2.
Made plans for this week and next week. All agreed that we should focus on the proposal.
I created google docs account for user stories. And we all managed to finish user stories and background during this week.

Week 3.
This week was focused on storyboards, I created a balsmiq project that everyone could use. We finished sprints, 
software architecture and everything else. My job for this week was cleaning up the proposal.
The goal was to submit the proposal Sunday night, which we did.

Week 4.
This week I worked on the environment by watching tutorials and reading a bunch of resources online. During this process I managed
to set up the database, back-end and front-end. A tiring process which was rewarding as I've never done this before. 
The goal before the progressive demo is to create a minimal viable product, which i believe our sprint 1 will be good for.
