**_ Database _**

1. Need someway to generate the database if the user doesn't have it
2. Need something like a csv file to load all of our data into the database.
3. Not so important, but looking into a remote access database that everyone can use.

4. Once we implement ER diagram, someone needs to create the tables then the models for them.

**_ Front end _**

1. Need to somehow figure a way to display recipes onto the screen
2. And we need to display them in card form
3. Animations will be cool but nah.

**_ Back end _**

1. auth.py is chunky, maybe find someway to reduce it
2. Make sure we try to add routes functions that pull in the information and
   separate functions that does what it requires. i.e sign_up and sign_up_fn.
